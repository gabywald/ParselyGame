# Parsely Game

Some idea to do a "rétro 1980's" textual video game inspired from "Parsely Game (see credits below and in [resources/1506997968929.pdf] ), a basic scenario is present. 

One of the idea was to make a distant server to play (i.e. some socket implementation available), REST could be an idea too !

It could be a start for a MOO (Multi-User-Dungeon Object-Oriented) with multiple users on same play !

Feel Free ("Open Code") to do a better game and gives Advices and / or Improvements. 

And yes, it is some pre-SCUMM retro challenge ! 
(SCUMM was an idea from LucasArt / LucasFilm Games ;-) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUMM )
